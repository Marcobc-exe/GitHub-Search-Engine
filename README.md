## Generate a Personal Access Token
1. Log in to GitHub: Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
2. Navigate to Settings: Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner, and then click on "Settings."
3. Access Developer Settings: Scroll down in the left sidebar and click on "Developer settings."
4. Generate Token: Click on "Personal access tokens" and then on "Tokens (classic)." Click on the "Generate new token" button.
5. Select Scopes: Give your token a description and select the scopes or permissions you need. For general usage, you might need the repo scope for repository access and user scope for user data access.
